Test your Knowledge

1.When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C#?
  If a string is going to remain constant throughout the program,
  then use String class object because a String object is immutable.
  If a string can change (example: lots of logic and operations in
  the construction of the string) then using a StringBuilder is the best option.

2.What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
  The base class for all arrays is The Array class defined in the System namespace.

3.How do you sort an array in C#?
  Array.Sort(intArray);

4.What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in an array?
  Array.Length;

5.Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
  No we cannot.

6.Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
  Clone() method makes a clone of the original array returning an exact length array.
  CopyTo() copies the elements from  original array to the destination array starting
  at the specified array index.
